# HousePricePredictor
This repository contains a basic implementation of a house price prediction web application using Flask and Linear Regression. The project demonstrates how to build a simple web-based interface where users can input house features, and the app predicts house prices based on a trained machine learning model.

Features:
Flask Web Application: A simple Flask app that serves as the backend for predicting house prices.
User-Friendly Interface: HTML and JavaScript form for users to input house features such as bedrooms, bathrooms, size, and zip code.
Machine Learning Model: Uses Linear Regression to predict house prices based on the provided dataset.
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values and encodes categorical variables using basic techniques.
Model Training: Trains a Linear Regression model using a CSV dataset with features like number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, house size, and zip code.
Deployment: Instructions for running the application locally on your machine.
